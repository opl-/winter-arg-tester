How do I use this?
---
1. Get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Pull this script (or just download it as a zip file [from here](https://github.com/opl-/winter-arg-tester/archive/master.zip) and unpack it somewhere).
3. Run the RunBruteForce.Bat, if this fails, continue to 4.
4. OR Open a console in the directory you downloaded the code to.
5. Run:
  * `node cli help` to print the help message.
  * `node cli password <password>` where `<password>` is the phrase you want to test to check it for all games.
  * `node cli bot` to run in bot mode, which automatically gets passwords from a database and tests them without you having to do anything.
