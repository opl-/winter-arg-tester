How do I use this?
---
1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Pull this script (or just download it as a zip file [from here](https://github.com/opl-/winter-arg-tester/archive/master.zip) and unpack it somewhere).
3. Run "RunBruteForce.bat" within the unpacked folder to start contributing to the community effort.
 
Or (Advanced Users):

   Open a console within the unpacked folder that you downloaded and run:
  * `node cli help` to print the help message.
  * `node cli password <password>` where `<password>` is the phrase you want to test on all games and on the /wintercomic/ page.
  * `node cli bot` to run in bot mode, which automatically gets passwords from a database and tests them without you having to do anything. This is the same as running RunBruteForce.bat.
